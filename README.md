# Project 1: Slopes Store - A Client Facing Experience Site
Requirements:
Tasked with creating a compelling experience from a created business model, create an individual project with Lightning web components as the primary user interface. These are surfaced through the use of Experience Cloud to create a customer or partner experience site that allows for the use of these new features, along with supporting Apex classes/triggers and declarative customizations.

To create this project I modeled the business after a online winter sports retailer named Slops, which sells all things related to winter sports such as skiis, snowboards, and other related outdoor gear. The customer can sign up using a client-facing experience site where they can browse available products, displayed through custom LWCs.

Roles/Responsibilities
 - Developed a business to model
 - Created LWC components to use on the experience site
 - Created a client-facing experience site
 - Developed Apex class to be used in conjunction with the components and the org data
 - Developed Apex triggers for the business that meet best practices
 - Implemented Sales and Service Cloud
 - Included Assignment Rules, Auto-Response Rules, Escalation Rules, and Campaigns from the cloud apps
 - Additional declarative customization to support the above features
